# EToD Audio

EToD Audio is an audio library I wrote for the [EToD Engine](https://docs.slatervans.com), built on top of [OpenAL Soft](https://openal-soft.org/). I've never written an audio library before so I figured I'd give it a shot, since I want to have a robust and powerful solution for EToD.

This is the first version of the library that was written over a few hours, so there is a lot missing. I'll update this with information about various limitations as I go.

## Currently Supports
- .ogg and .mp3 files
- 3D spatial playback of audio sources

## TODO
- There are like a thousand compiler warnings, so definitely sort that out
- Unload audio sources
- Stream audio files
- Audio source seeking
- Listener positioning API
- Wave file support
- Effects

## Next version
I'm focusing on audio file streaming, seeking and unloading.

## Example
Check out the `EToDAudio-Examples` project for more, but it's super simple:
```cpp
// Initialize the audio engine
ETOD::Audio::Init();
// Load audio source from file, bool is for whether the source
// should be in 3D space or not
auto source = ETOD::AudioSource::LoadFromFile(filename, true);
// Play audio source
ETOD::Audio::Play(source);
```
and you can set various attributes on a source as well:
```cpp
source.SetPosition(x, y, z);
source.SetGain(2.0f);
source.SetLoop(true);
```
